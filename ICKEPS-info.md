Dear participant of the ICAPS 2024 Summer School,

This email contains information about the International Competition on Knowledge Engineering for Planning and Scheduling (ICKEPS 2024) that will take place on Wednesday as part of the Summer School.

# Teams:

In ICKEPS, teams of 5-6 students will cooperate to engineer planning knowledge models of good quality. Teams have been already formed, and you can find them here [1]. Feel free to get in touch with your teammates before the event, of course.

# Preparation:

No specific preparation is needed, besides some knowledge of PDDL and the ability to run planning engines.
With regards to PDDL, you should have received some pointers in a previous email from the Summer School organisers, that for your convenience are made available here [2]. If you plan to use online PDDL editors or plug-ins, suggestions are here [3].
With regards to planning engines, besides the ones provided by the online editors above, some pointers are here [4]. It is completely up to your team to select the planning engine to use -- not necessarily from the provided list.

# The competition:

Instructions and details will be given on the day. The idea is that you'll be given scenarios to encode in PDDL. To win, your team will need to demonstrate the quality of the models, to show that some planning engine can solve the corresponding problems, and to discuss the approach you used to create the models.

You may want to take a look at the last edition of ICKEPS [5] to get a taste of it, but be aware that things will be slightly different this year.

That's all, see you in Banff!

[2] You should be able to read PDDL and write very simple PDDL models. For those new to PDDL, you could do (prior to the summer school) a short hands-on tutorial:

Coincidentally, that tutorial uses BlocksWorld as an example, which is also the running example of the summer school. That tutorial is a 1 hour video, but it's hands-on, so you are supposed to pause it at times and perform some exercises. Also note that the first 40 minutes are a beginner's introduction to AI planning, so if you are only new to PDDL, you can start at 39:40. The required material can be downloaded here:

If you don't want to listen to Pascal speak that long :), you can also just read the slides:
